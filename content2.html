      <h1>Applications of binary numbers</h1>
      <p>
        The world has evolved from simple mechanics to advanced quantum modeling. What has not
        changed is the Human will to count the entities. Humans originally created the Decimal
        Number System but because of the machine’s and the Logic’s inability to do complex functions
        on them, the Binary Number System were invented as a manifestation of Boolean Logic, where
        there can only exist two states – a True or a False, denoted by 1 and 0. All other states
        are defined by various combinations of these two primary states. <br />
        Boolean Logic was first invented by George Boole who first defined the algebraic system of
        logic in the 1930s. The invention of such a system has had an immense breakthrough in the
        world of electronics and computers. <br />
        Since then theses Tiny Binary Numbers (the two bits: 1 and 0) have had numerous
        applications- from storage of millions of entries of data to recording of HD Movies and High
        End Audio, from image processing to numerous other DSP (Digital Signal Processing)
        applications.
      </p>
      <h3>What are Binary Numbers</h3>
      <p>
        ‘The binary numeral system or base-2 number system represents numeric values using two
        symbols, 0 and 1. More specifically, the usual base-2 system is a positional notation with a
        radix of 2′. <br />
        In simpler words, in Binary Number system all the possible values are expressed using two
        digits, 0 and 1. The 0 symbol also symbolizes a ‘False’ state while a 1 symbolizes a ‘True’
        state. <br />
        It would be interesting to note that the Indian writer Pingala (200 BC) developed advanced
        mathematical concepts for describing prosody, and hence presented the world with the first
        known description of a binary numeral system. <br />
        In our daily used Decimal Number system, we count items in the following manner we have the
        following 10 different symbols which can define 10 different entities. <br />
        The primary set of numbers are : {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. <br />
        All the complex numbers like 100, 1246 are further simply the combination of the 10 primary
        symbols. Every time the count gets greater than the 10 primary symbol set, we increase the
        position of our numbers (or Decimal place) and hence we get a new set of 10 more possible
        values. <br />
        E.g. The ‘13′ symbol means the first 10 symbols as it is, then increasing the decimal place
        by 1 and then adding the first four symbols from the primary set. <br />
        Figure explaining how the Decimal Number System Works <br />
        In Binary System, since we only have two symbols (0 and 1) in our primary set, so our
        Decimal Place (or in this case the Binary place) is shifted by 2n factor, where n symbolizes
        the Binary Place. <br />
        Figure showing the Binary Number System <br />
        Certainly, the Binary Number System can get too much ‘bulky’ to express larger values
        (Binary equalent of 5789 would be 1011010011101) but because this system has only 2 primary
        states (‘True’:1 and ‘False’:0) it can easily be understood by machines.
      </p>
      <h3>What is Boolean Logic</h3>
      <p>
        Now that we understand what is Boolean Algebra, it is time to have a look on the ‘rules’ or
        ‘laws’ defining how the symbols in this system would interact with each other. Boolean Logic
        does this. The basic of this type of logic is also comparison between two values. <br />
        There are 3 primary logics – The AND Logic, the OR Logic, and the NOT Logic. <br />
        AND: The AND logic means yield a value TRUE (1) if both the values in comparison have a
        ‘True’ value (1). <br />
        OR: The OR logic means a value of TRUE (1) is returned if either of the values in comparison
        have a ‘True’ value (1). <br />
        NOT: The NOT logic simply inverts a given value. For e.g. a it will change a True value to
        False and a False value to True if applied on a variable. <br />
        Of these 3 primary logics, only NOT can operate over a single variable, rest two need a
        minimum of two variables. <br />There are other logics to, like XOR, Ex-OR etc. but these
        can be obtained by the combination of these 3.
