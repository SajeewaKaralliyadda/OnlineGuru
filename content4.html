      <h1>Internet</h1>
      <p>

        we can’t live without it. Besides, the internet is an invention of high-end science and
        modern technology. Apart from that, we are connected to internet 24×7. Also, we can send big
        and small messages and information faster than ever. In this essay on the Internet, we are
        going to discuss various things related to the internet.
      </p>
      <h3>Reach of Internet</h3>
      <p>
        It is very difficult to estimate the area that the internet cover. Also, every second
        million people remain connected to it with any problem or issue. Apart from that, just like
        all the things the internet also has some good and bad effect on the life of people. So the
        first thing which we have to do is learn about the good and bad effect of the internet.
        <br />

        Good effects of the internet mean all those things that the internet make possible. Also,
        these things make our life easier and safer. <br />

        Bad effects of the internet mean all those things that we can no longer do because of the
        internet. Also, these things cause trouble for oneself and others too. <br />

        You can access in any corner of the world. Also, it is very easy to use and manage. In
        today’s world, we cannot imagine our life without it. <br />
      </p>
      <h3>Uses Of Internet</h3>
      <p>
        From the time it first came into existence until now the internet has completed a long
        journey. Also, during this journey, the internet has adopted many things and became more
        user-friendly and interactive. Besides, every big and small things are available on internet
        and article or material that you require can be obtainable from internet.<br />

        Tim Berners-Lee can be called one of the main father of internet as he invented/discovered
        the WWW (World Wide Web) which is used on every website. Also, there are millions of pages
        and website on the internet that it will take you years to go through all of them.<br />

        The Internet can be used to do different things like you can learn, teach, research, write,
        share, receive, e-mail, explore, and surf the internet.<br />
      </p>
      <h3>Convenience Due To Internet</h3>
      <p>
        Because of internet, our lives have become more convenient as compared to the times when we
        don’t have internet. Earlier, we have to stand in queues to send mails (letters), for
        withdrawing or depositing money, to book tickets, etc. but after the dawn of the internet,
        all these things become quite easy. Also, we do not have to waste our precious time standing
        in queues.<br />

        Also, the internet has contributed a lot to the environment as much of the offices
        (government and private), school and colleges have become digital that saves countless
        paper.<br />

        Although, there is no doubt that the internet had made our life easier and convenient but we
        can’t leave the fact that it has caused many bigger problems in the past. And with the
        speed, we are becoming addict to it a day in will come when it will become our basic
        necessity.<br />
